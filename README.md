# RadioLib ![Build Status](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

### _One radio library to rule them all!_

## Universal wireless communication library for embedded devices

## See the [Wiki](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/wiki) for further information. See the [GitHub Pages](https://jgromes.github.io/RadioLib) for detailed and up-to-date API reference.

RadioLib allows its users to integrate all sorts of different wireless communication modules, protocols and even digital modes into a single consistent system.
Want to add a Bluetooth interface to your LoRa network? Sure thing! Do you just want to go really old-school and play around with radio teletype, slow-scan TV, or even Hellschreiber using nothing but a cheap radio module? Why not!

RadioLib was originally created as a driver for [__RadioShield__](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioShield), but it can be used to control as many different wireless modules as you like - or at least as many as your microcontroller can handle!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where should I start?
First of all, take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/tree/master/examples) and the [Wiki](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/wiki) - especially the [Basics](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/wiki/Basics) page. There's a lot of useful information over there. If something isn't working as expected, try searching the [issues](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/issues/).

### Help, my module isn't working!
The fastest way to get help is by creating an [issue](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/issues/new/choose) using the appropriate template. It is also highly recommended to try running the examples first - their functionality is tested from time to time and they should work. Finally, RadioLib is still under development, which means that sometimes, backwards-incompatible changes might be introduced. Though these are kept at minimum, sometimes it is unavoidable. You can check the [release changelog](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/releases) to find out if there's been such a major change recently.

### RadioLib doesn't support my module! What should I do?
Start by creating new issue (if it doesn't exist yet). If you have some experience with microcontrollers and C/C++ in general, you can try to add the support yourself! Use the template files in `/extras/` folder to get started. This is by far the fastest way to implement new modules into RadioLib, since I can't be working on everything all the time. If you don't trust your programming skills enough to have a go at it yourself, don't worry. I will try to implement all requested modules, but it will take me a while.
